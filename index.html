        <p>In 1952, Lithuania suffered from great damages caused by the kangaroos and their explosives. Australia, being a generous ally, fought with the lithuanian army to defeat the kangaroos. They failed, and the kangaroos took over Lithuania, killing all their inhabitants. Australia, fearing the consequences of the downfall of Lithuania, sent millions of Australians to populate few cities of Lithuania. While Lithuania still has quite the amount of kangaroos, australians have infiltrated the territory and faked their identities to appear as if Lithuania is still a normal country.</p>
        <p>Around 1967, news spread the information that Lithuania was no longer inhabitable due to extreme kangaroo home invasions. While it was a true fact, the government succeeded in faking a normal civilization. The kangaroos were enraged by the situation, now well aware that the australians were attempting to fake a human inhabited country, started swarming the streets and protesting against the australian government. These protests go on until today, but no one hears about them due to the fact that the australian government is extremely good at hiding secrets from western civilization.</p>
